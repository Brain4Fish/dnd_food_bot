#  DND Party Food Tracker

## Why?

We love to play DND (dungeon and dragons) RPG game. It takes pretty big amout of time and of cource we wanna eat somethig except snacks. We order food via deliver but we have one problem, we spend plenty amount of time to decide, who should order food today an what kind of food was in previous times. To help us save some time on this I have written this small telegram bot, that will help us save some time and start adventure a little bit earlier

In first view you can think, that we spend not so much time on this. BUT, let's calculate. For example, we spend 10 minutes to choose who should order the food every play. Every month we play at least 4 times, that means that we spend 40 minutes per month to remembering past orders. But in most cases we play 6-8 times per month which will give 80 (!) minutes of choosing food every month or 12 * 80 = 960 minutes or 16 hours of choosing per year! You can spend this time in cool fighting with ogre or licking mimic door
